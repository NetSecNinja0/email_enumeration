# üìß Email Enumeration via Verbose Login Feedback

This script automates the process of **enumerating valid email addresses** by interacting with a vulnerable web application's verbose login functionality. It checks which email addresses exist based on server response messages.

## üöÄ How It Works

The script sends a `POST` request to a login endpoint, providing a **test password** for each email.

It analyzes the server's **JSON response** to distinguish between:

- ‚úÖ **Valid emails** ‚Äî When the response indicates an incorrect password but **not** a non-existent email.
- ‚ùå **Invalid emails** ‚Äî When the server clearly states the **email does not exist**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This technique relies on **verbose error messages** from the server ‚Äî a common misconfiguration in web applications.
